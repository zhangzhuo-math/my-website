<div style="margin-bottom: -14px;">I have done some research in number theory. Here are the papers I wrote:</div>

* *The Relative Error in the Chebotarev Density Theorem*, with J. Thorner.

  The Chebotarev Density Theorem is a generalization of the prime number theorem in arithmetic progressions and plays a fundamental role in algebraic number theory. In this project we leverage the analytic properties of nonabelian Artin L-functions (that satisfy the Artin holomorphy conjecture) to improve the best-known error bounds in this theorem.


* *On a Special Metric in Cyclotomic Fields*, with

Hello, I'm Zhuo Zhang, a fourth year undergraduate student studying math at the University of Illinois, Urbana Champaign.

I am broadly interested in many areas of math, especially number theory and topology.

* I am interested in the interaction between analytic and algebraic number theory. I really enjoy thinking about L-functions because they have extremely important connections to many areas of math (e.g. elliptic curves, modular forms, representation theory, K-theory etc.).

* On the other hand, I am also fond of thinking about manifolds, vector bundles, curvatures, and their cohomologies, etc. They provide a profound description of the geometry of our world.

One thing to note is that these fields are not disjoint. There are many connections between them (e.g. the prime geodesic theorem, trace formulae, arithmetic quantum chaos, etc.).

In fact, I believe that any two branches in mathematics are connected in some natural way.
